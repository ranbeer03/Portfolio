      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Being raised by an artist mother meant growing up with paintings and sculptures in every corner of my house. As I grew older, my fascination with her work grew more and more and finally at 13 I decided to learn how to paint. I instantly fell in love with the process of painting and it became the most cathartic part of my day during my teenage years. Recently in 2021, I completed my senior diploma in fine arts and moved to London to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. London further exposed me to a diverse range of global styles and mediums which has increasingly influenced my work. No matter the medium or surface, painting is my favourite form of expression and I dream of one day having my paintings in every corner of the world.</p>
